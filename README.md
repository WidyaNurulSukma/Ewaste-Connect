# eWasteConnect

## Project Overview
eWasteConnect is a web-based application designed to address the growing challenge of electronic waste (e-waste) management. It facilitates responsible disposal of electronic devices by connecting users with collectors through an efficient, transparent, and sustainable platform. The project aims to reduce environmental impact, promote circular economy practices, and raise awareness about sustainable e-waste management.

## Key Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login using JWT for session management.
- **Pickup Scheduling**: Intuitive interface for users to schedule e-waste pickups with detailed device descriptions and location selection.
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Transparent tracking of pickup requests with statuses (Pending, Scheduled, Completed).
- **Dual Role System**: Supports users (disposing e-waste) and collectors (managing pickups) with dedicated dashboards.
- **Inventory Management**: Full CRUD operations for users to manage electronic device records.
- **Educational Content**: "eWaste Tip" section to increase awareness about responsible e-waste disposal.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Node.js, MongoDB, JWT, Brevo API (email notifications), Cloudinary (media management).
- **Frontend**: Modern framework with responsive design for desktop and mobile.
- **Database**: MongoDB for flexible and scalable data management.
- **External APIs**: Planned integration with Google Maps API (not yet implemented due to registration limitations).

## Project Goals
- Promote sustainable e-waste disposal to reduce environmental harm.
- Support Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) including responsible consumption (SDG 12), economic growth (SDG 8), sustainable cities (SDG 11), and climate action (SDG 13).
- Create economic opportunities for collectors within a circular economy framework.

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository-link]`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure environment variables for MongoDB, Brevo API, and Cloudinary.
4. Run the application: `npm start`

## Future Enhancements
